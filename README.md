# GDB_Eflags

Created a simple python script that can be imported in gdb to change/reset the STATUS FLAGS while running the program.

To import the script into the gdb.. 

1. Run gdb
2. use source <script_name>
3. change_flags ["Enter this command in gdb and there you go"]

The Script does not handle any exceptions at the moment.

Incase, you want to contribute then you are most welcome to fork the project and make your contributions.
